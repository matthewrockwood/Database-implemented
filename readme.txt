I did a ton for this project, so hopefully I can get some extra credit. I plan to post this on github and show this off. If you can't find something please let me know.

A few things I did that was not required in the HW
-You added multithreading to allow for loading and a loading status
-Made my status bar function and update when things fail
-Made my project a riot games employees directory
-Made the about page locked in so you can only access the about
-Created a table of registered users
-Created most of the project Bug free
-Added a status bar that indicate what to do next, and if something was successful
-Did the extra credit
-Double click a empty row to create a new one, make sure to deselect row befor trying to double click
-Deselect row button
-To change In row Double click the cell and hit enter when done
-Even when u update it in the row, it also update in the DB and in the textField
-All usernames and passwords are saved in the preference txt
