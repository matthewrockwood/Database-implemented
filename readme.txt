I did a ton for this project, so hopefully I can get some extra credit. I plan to post this on github and show this off
A few things I did that was not required in the HW
-You added multithreading to allow for loading and a loading status
-Made my status bar function and update when things fail
-Made my project a riot games employees directory
-Made the about page locked in so you can only access the about
-Created a table of registered users
-Created most of the project Bug free
